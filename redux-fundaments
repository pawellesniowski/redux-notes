We have one huge store, which holds the whole app state.

## Instalation in app
  npm i --save redux react-redux

## Steps to set redux:
   1. Create const in src/constans.js
      export const DO_SOMETHING = "DO_SOMETHING"
   2. Create Action Creator (function which returns Action), in src/actions/index.js .
      export const addReminder = ()=>{
        const action = {
          type: DO_SOMETHING,
          text           
        }
        return action;
      }
